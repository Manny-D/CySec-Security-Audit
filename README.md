<h1>Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project is to perform an audit of fictional company named Botium Toys and their cybersecurity program. The audit needs to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are classified as “high risk,” and present an overall strategy for improving the security posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

<h2>Scope</h2> 
Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:

- Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
- Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
- Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.
  
<h2>Goals</h2>
The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:

- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant 
- Fortify system controls
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management 
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks 
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

<h2>Botium Toys: Risk assessment</h2>
<h3>Current assets</h3>
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 

- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs  
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
- Internet access
- Internal network
- Vendor access management
- Data center hosting services  
- Data retention and storage
- Badge readers
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring 
</br>

<h2>Risk description</h2>
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have the proper controls in place and may not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 
</br>

<h2>Control best practices</h2>
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to managing assets. Additionally, they will need to determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.
</br>

<h2>Risk score</h2>
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to necessary compliance regulations and standards.
</br>

<h2>Additional comments</h2>
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be lost. The likelihood of a lost asset or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not adhering to required regulations and standards related to keeping customer data private.

<h1>Stakeholder memorandum</h1>
<b>TO</b>: IT Manager, Stakeholders </br>
<b>FROM</b>: Manny Dador </br>
<b>DATE</b>: 6/20/23 </br>
<b>SUBJECT</b>: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations 
</br>
</br>

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.


<b>Scope</b>: 
The entire security program at Botium Toys. All systems and assets were assessed alongside internal processes and procedures including:

- Current user permissions
- Current implemented controls
- Current procedures and protocols
- Alignment with PCS-DSS and GDPR standards


<b>Goals</b>: 
The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:

- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant 
- Fortify system controls
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management 
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks 
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements 


<b>Critical findings (must be addressed immediately)</b>: 
Several controls are needed to meet audit goals including:

- Least Privilege and separation of duties
- Disaster recovery plans
- Password policies, access control and account management policies, and a password management system
- Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- Encryption (for secure data transactions)
- Backups
- Antivirus software - detect and quarantine known threats
- Manual monitoring, maintenance and interventions for legacy systems
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance
- Fire detection and prevention systems


<b>Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need)</b>: 

- Time-controlled safe - reduce attack surface/impact of physical threats
- Adequate lighting - limit “hiding” places to deter threats
- Locking cabinets
- Signage indicating alarm service provider
<br />


<h2>Summary / Recommendations</h2>
It is recommended that critical findings relating to compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR be addressed as soon as possible, as Botium Toys accepts online payments from customers globally, including the E.U. 
<br />

Also, since one of the goals of the audit is to adapt to the concept of least permissions, SOC1 and SOC2 guidance related to user access policies and overall data safety should be used to develop appropriate policies and procedures. 

Disaster recovery plans and backups are also critical since they support business continuity in the event of an incident. Integrating an IDS and AV software into the current systems will support our ability to identify and mitigate potential risks, and could help with intrusion detection, since existing legacy systems require manual monitoring and intervention. 

To further secure assets housed at Botium Toys’ single physical location, locks and CCTV should be utilized to secure physical assets and to monitor and investigate potential threats. 
While not immediately needed, using encryption and having a time-controlled safe, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, fire detection and prevention systems, and signage indicating alarm service provider can further improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
